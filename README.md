The goal of this project is to deploy on the server a simple copy of the AirBnB website.

We wonâ€™t implement all the features, only some of them to cover all fundamental concepts of the higher level programming track.

The application will be composed by:

A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell
A database or files that store data
